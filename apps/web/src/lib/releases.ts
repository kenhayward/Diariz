Diariz records audio — from your microphone, or Windows system/loopback audio via the desktop app —
and transcribes it server-side with **WhisperX** (word-level timestamps) and **pyannote** speaker
diarization. You get speaker-labelled, timestamped segments you can rename, edit, and play back
(per segment or the whole recording), and can re-transcribe at any time.

It can **summarise** recordings and let you **chat across one or more transcripts** — with file
attachments, a context-usage dial, and saved conversations — using an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint
you configure. Recordings organise into **sections** with drag-and-drop ordering.

Diariz is **multi-user** with role-based access: people request access, an administrator grants it,
and each user sets up their own account and keeps their own private recordings, transcripts, and chats.

The first versioned release of Diariz. It introduces a **Major.Minor.Build** scheme, this **Release
Notes** page, and an **About** box in the account menu (with the app version, build, a capabilities
summary, links to these notes and GitHub, third-party disclaimers, and copyright). The API now reports
its version at \`/health\`.

This entry also serves as the baseline summary of everything Diariz does today:

- **Capture** audio from the browser microphone, or Windows system/loopback audio via the Electron
  desktop shell.
- **Transcribe** server-side with WhisperX (faster-whisper large-v3) for word-level timestamps and
  **pyannote 3.1** for speaker diarization, orchestrated through a Redis-stream job queue with live
  status over SignalR.
- **Review** speaker-labelled, timestamped segments: rename speakers (preserved across re-transcribes),
  edit segment text, and play back per-segment or the whole recording. Re-transcribe with a chosen model.
- **Summarise** recordings (with automatic naming) and **chat across one or more transcripts** —
  streaming replies, a context-usage dial, PDF/text attachments, and saved/reloadable conversations —
  via a per-user (or server-default) OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint, with the API key encrypted at rest.
- **Organise** recordings into sections with drag-and-drop ordering and cross-group moves.
- **Multi-user RBAC**: Standard / Administrator / Platform Administrator roles, an access-request →
  admin-grant → account-setup lifecycle (one-time email link, with an in-app fallback when SMTP is
  unconfigured), and admin user management. Every user's data is isolated to them.
- Light/Dark/Auto theming throughout.
